This document is an example showing the different functionalities of this boilerplate. It can also be used as a quick cheat sheet to find how to write quickly things.

Notice that we do not have to specify the path of the image. By default, the image will be searched in \texttt{source/images/}. Also, \texttt{UseLATEX.cmake} allows to insert almost any image format: it will be converted internally before being inserted in the document. That's why the image extension doesn't need to be included.
